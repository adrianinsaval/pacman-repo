Personal repository of pacman packages I use. To use the repository add the following to `/etc/pacman.conf`
```
[adrianinsaval]
SigLevel = Optional TrustAll
Server = https://github.com/adrianinsaval/pacman-repo/releases/download/archlinux-x86_64/
```
I plan on eventually signing the packages but has to be used like this for now.
